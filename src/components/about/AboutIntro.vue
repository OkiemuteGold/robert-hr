                            The beginnings of the Stud Fernández Millares are
                            born from the motivation and admiration of Roberto
                            Fernandez and Mónica Millares for purebred Arabian
                            horses. In 2018 they start breeding purebred Arabian
                            horses.

                            The influence of the Yeguada Ybarra in our beginning
                            is manifest. After several visits to "La Cascajera"
                            in Seville, the couple decides to acquire a batch of
                            mares from the most outstanding mares and a stallion
                            Kirov son of Vigia, one of the most important horses
                            of the stud farm.

                            Zubialdea Arabians Stud, from internationally
                            multi-awarded lines such as Ajman Moniscione and Aja

                            With this basis, the beginning of horse breeding of
                            the pure Arabian breed is established as base race
                            to bring horses with class, nobles and beauty

                            breeding of the Hispano-Arab horse, a year later in
                            2020 in union with the Millares family, three new
                            Spanish mares are incorporated, thus also forging
                            the desire to have Hispano-Arabian horses with our
                            iron. <br />
                            Nestled in a unique pasture in the low countryside
                            of Trigueros in the province of Huelva, the horses
                            are bred in freedom in the Cortijo Los Millares,
                            under the union not only of the owners but also of
                            the dedicated staff who are daily responsible for
                            the care of the horses.
